        "description": "Say goodbye to dry, bland grilled chicken breasts. This recipe guarantees juicy, flavorful chicken every time.Sometimes in cooking the simplest dishes are the hardest to get right, and grilled chicken is a perfect example. Because boneless chicken breasts are so lean, they often turn out dry, rubbery, and bland. Contrary to popular belief, marinating alone will not prevent grilled chicken from drying out; in fact, it’s often the marinade that causes the problem!",

        "description": "Rabbit meat has been around for centuries in cuisines around the world, from Moroccan tagines to European soups and stews. Deliciously sweet with a flavorful, slightly gamey character, rabbit has been a staple in traditional cuisines because hunters could easily catch them during the warm months of the year. A great meat to braise or roast, rabbit meat needs a good amount of liquid to retain moisture, so a stew is also the the perfect way to cook this protein. When it's cooked slowly, as this recipe does, you'll sit down to a tender, juicy, and delicious meal.",
